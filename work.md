## What I'm working on right now

I"m working with [Professor Liangyan Gui](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/lgui) doing research in predictive vision as well as [Professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu) and her Phd student [Aamir Hasan](https://aamzhas.github.io/) on reinforcement learning in advanced driver asistance systems (ADAS)!

### Code moderator for [Software Design Studio (CS 126)](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/CS126/sp2021/)

During the Spring semester of my freshman year, I was a code moderator for one of the classes here at UIUC called Software Design Studio where we try to emphasize good coding practices, smart design choices, and proper documentation for code. As a code moderator, I was  responsible for 5 talented and driven students where I view their code and offer constructive criticism to help them write better code. It was a rewarding experience seeing the student's code quality improve so much over the semester.
