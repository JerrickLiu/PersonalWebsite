## Hello! My name is Jerrick Liu.

I'm helping build Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus. I recently graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) studying computer science. Previously at [NVIDIA's](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/).

I like computers, AI/ML, and making things go fast.

I also like [playing](assets/audio/AudioExport.m4a) [piano](assets/audio/AudioExport-2.m4a).

### Good AI/ML papers

Here are a few papers/articles that I've found incredibly fascinating and thought I'd link here.

- [OpenAI Hide and Seek](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/)
- [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules)
- [Feudal/Hierarchical Reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161)
- [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/projects/five/)
- [Adversarial RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJgEMpVFwB)

### Other good reads (Not necessarily RL)

- [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/)
- [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934)
- [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)
- [GameGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12126.pdf)
