## Hello! My name is Jerrick Liu

I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I'll be joining [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a deep learning software engineer working on [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) under [Scott Ricketts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-ricketts-b6a12346/). I most recently worked with the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/) doing some cool stuff with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Head over to my [projects](projects/projects.html) and my [work experience](work.md) pages to see what I've done and what I'm working on! Check out my [resume](assets/resume/JerrickLiuResume.pdf) too.

### Research Interests

My reserach interests lie in reinforcement learning right now. Specifically, hiearchical reinforcement learnining and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The first question asks how well can RL agents plan ahead when there is a hiearchy of objectives and rewards? The second question deals with multiple agents existing in a single environment and how well they can work together to achieve some goal. Here are a few papers/articles that I've found incredibly fascinating and thought I'd link here.

- [OpenAI Hide and Seek](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/)
- [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules)
- [Feudal/Hierarchical Reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161)
- [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/projects/five/)
- [Adversarial RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJgEMpVFwB)

### Other good reads (Not necessarily RL)

- [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/)
- [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934)
- [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)
- [GameGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12126.pdf)

### Interested in what I do?

Reach me at my email! Check out my GitHub! Connect with me on LinkedIn! Links are below.

### Some of my loves

- Golf.
- Piano. 
- Ping-pong.
- Noodles.
- [My amazing girlfriend](/assets/img/mymosaic.png) (The link leads to a mosaic I made of a picture of us created with thounsands of other pictuers of us. My [data structures class](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/) allowed me to do this and it's really cool. Warning though, this image is **huge** and may take a minute to load.)
