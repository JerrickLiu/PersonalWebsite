## Hello! My name is Jerrick Liu

I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I'm also working with the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/) doing some cool stuff with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Head over to my [projects](projects/projects.html) and my [work experience](work.md) pages to see what I've done and what I'm working on! Check out my [resume](assets/resume/JerrickLiuResume.pdf) too.

### Research Interests

My reserach interests lie in reinforcement learning right now. Specifically, hiearchical reinforcement learnining and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The first question asks how well can RL agents plan ahead when there is a hiearchy of objectives and rewards? The second question deals with multiple agents existing in a single environment and how well they can work together to achieve some goal. Here are a few papers/articles that I've found incredibly fascinating and thought I'd link here.

My [data structures class](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/) allowed me to do this and it's really cool. Warning though, this image is **huge** and may take a minute to load.)
