## Hello New World

As I sit here and reflect on my time at the University of Illinois, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions. I am so proud and grateful to have received my degree in computer science, but at the same time, I am sad to be leaving this place and the people who have made it feel like home.

Over the past two and a half years, I have met some of the most incredible people, who have not only challenged me academically but have also become my closest friends. I have learned from some of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors, who have inspired me to pursue my passions and strive for excellence. It's sentimental, my last semester there I had some amazing experiences. The titular and mystical college experience everyone talks about I thought I truly felt my last three months there. It's a bit sad to think about how I *probably* won't have these "college" experiences anymore with my close friends.

As I graduate and move on to the next chapter of my life, I can't help but feel a little bit scared. The world outside of college can seem intimidating and overwhelming at times. In college, there was always a path to do things. Do this, do that, and you'll get good grades. In the real world, that's obviously different. The path forward always isn't clear. However, I'm excited for it. I'm working at a great company on a great team and great product that empowers a majority of deep learning everywhere.

So as I say goodbye to this place, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has helped me along the way. To my friends, who have supported me through the highs and lows, thank you. To my professors, who have challenged and inspired me, thank you. And to my family, who have always believed in me and encouraged me to follow my dreams, thank you.

I will always look back on my time at the University of Illinois with fond memories and a deep sense of accomplishment. I am excited for what the future holds, and I am grateful for the foundation that this university has provided for me. Congratulations to my fellow graduates, and here's to a bright future ahead!
