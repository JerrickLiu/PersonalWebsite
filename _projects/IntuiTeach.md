In a week long virtual hackathon, me and three other members created IntuiTeach, a web app paired with Zoom that allows teachers to write questions about a certain lecture they are going to have and as a vide lecture progresses, the teacher is able to pose live questions throughout the call. IntuiTeach also promotes online engagement of younger learners with our reward system.

I helped developed the backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to store necessary data for our web app.
