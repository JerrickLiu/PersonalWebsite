During the summer of 2021, I worked on a research project centered around natural language processing and reinforcement learning. I'll be getting to work with transformers (specifically [Bidirectional Encoder Represenations (BERT)](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)) to hopefully train up a chatbot that can provide us a lot of important information depending on what we ask it. We're hopefully going to reinforce the learning of the chatbot as well using [Ray and RLlib](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252) to provide more satsifactory answers.
