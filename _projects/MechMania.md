In a 24 hour A.I. hackathon hosted by MechMania and ACM@UIUC in their annual Reflections Projections event, me and three other members created a game bot in Python that would play in a MMO world designed by MechMania.

I helped develop the game algorithms and heursitics in Python that helped our team win 2nd place overall at the hackathon. (We all got Nintendo switches!)
