## Hello! My name is Jerrick Liu.

I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I'm also working with [Professor Liangyan Gui](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/lgui) doing research in predictive vision as well as [Professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu) and her Phd student [Aamir Hasan](https://aamzhas.github.io/) on reinforcement learning in advanced driver asistance systems (ADAS). I'm currently working at Google as a Software Engineer Intern on Google Cloud's [Vertex A.I.](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) team. I previously worked at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a deep learning software engineer intern working on [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) under [Yang Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-xu-66293039/). I most recently worked with the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/) doing some cool stuff with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Head over to my [projects](projects/projects.html) and my [work experience](work.md) pages to see what I've done and what I'm working on! Check out my [resume](assets/resume/JerrickLiuResume.pdf) too.

I also love [playing](assets/audio/AudioExport.m4a) [piano](assets/audio/AudioExport-2.m4a).

### Research Interests

My reserach interests lie in reinforcement learning right now. Specifically, hiearchical reinforcement learnining and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The first question asks how well can RL agents plan ahead when there is a hiearchy of objectives and rewards? The second question deals with multiple agents existing in a single environment and how well they can work together to achieve some goal. Here are a few papers/articles that I've found incredibly fascinating and thought I'd link here.

- [OpenAI Hide and Seek](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/)
- [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules)
- [Feudal/Hierarchical Reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161)
- [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/projects/five/)
- [Adversarial RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJgEMpVFwB)
